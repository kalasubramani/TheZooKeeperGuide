                    Coconut, the rare white male giraffe, is a captivating and
                    elusive presence within the zoo. Standing tall with his
                    majestic white coat, Coconut is a striking figure that
                    commands attention and awe. His lack of traditional spots
                    sets him apart from other giraffes, making him a rare gem in
                    the animal kingdom.

                    Despite his majestic appearance, Coconut is known for his
                    <b>shy and reserved</b> character. He often prefers the
                    outskirts of his enclosure, seeking solace in the shadows of
                    tall trees or behind natural features. He is gentle and
                    introverted nature, and he tends to be cautious in his
                    interactions with both other giraffes and zoo visitors.

                    Mella, the lioness, is a magnificent and proud resident of
                    the zoo. As the "big mommy," Mella has given birth to a
                    lone, precious cub recently, and her demeanor has shifted to
                    one of <em>heightened protectiveness and defensiveness</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Visitors can observe Mella pacing back and forth near the
                    den, a clear indication of her watchful and maternal
                    instincts as she keeps a vigilant eye on her cub. Due to
                    Mella's protective nature, access to her and the cub is
                    strictly limited. Only senior zookeepers, with their wealth
                    of experience and understanding of Mella's behavior, are
                    entrusted with handling her. This precaution is in place to
                    maintain a stress-free environment for the lioness and her
                    cub, prioritizing their health and comfort.

                    Karl, the rare white lion cub, is a living treasure at the
                    zoo, hailing from the esteemed Timbavati Private Nature
                    Reserve in South Africa. White lions like Karl hold a

                    recessive genetic trait, makes him stand out in contrast to
                    the more common golden hues of other lions. He's just three

                    Cookie, the tamarin monkey, is a pint-sized bundle of
                    <b>curiosity and sociability</b> that steals the hearts of

                  <p>
                    This little guy is a natural observer, and it's not uncommon
                    to find him perched in his exhibit, carefully watching the

                  <p>
                    One of Cookie's distinctive behaviors is his love for scent
                    marking. Anything new that enters his environment becomes an
                    instant candidate for a touch of Cookie's personal
                    ownership. From exhibit features to the keepers themselves,
                    Cookie enthusiastically marks everything with tiny hugs.

                  <p>
                    When it comes to snack time, Cookie's playful demeanor
                    shines even brighter. He eagerly makes his way onto the
                    keeper's shoulder, showcasing his trust and affection.

                  <!-- Description of the Earl's characteristics -->
                  <p>
                    Earl, the proboscis monkey, is a fascinating member of his
                    primate family, known for his striking resemblance to humans
                    and his <b>entertaining antics</b>. Proboscis monkeys are
                    renowned for their distinctive long noses, potbellies, and
                    expressive faces, giving them an uncanny human-like
                    appearance.
                    <i>Yes. They are too human!!</i>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of Earl's favorite pastimes is displaying his agility by
                    frequently leaping from tree limbs and making daring
                    splashes into the water below, much to the delight of
                    onlookers. His comical belly flops and acrobatic maneuvers
                    add a touch of humor to his otherwise regal demeanor, making
                    him a standout character in the zoo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, despite his playful nature, there is a crucial
                    aspect to Earl's care – he should not be fed bananas under
                    any circumstances.
                    <strong>Bananas are known to be fatal </strong>to proboscis
                    monkeys.

                  <p>
                    Wren, the freshwater crocodile, is an intriguing and
                    formidable resident of the zoo. However, unlike some of his
                    more sociable zoo counterparts, Wren prefers to maintain a
                    respectful distance from humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Known for his wariness of human presence, Wren is not one to
                    seek out interaction. His preference for solitude is a
                    natural aspect of his disposition, aligning with the
                    instincts of a creature adapted to life in the water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wren's self-protective instincts are evident, and it's
                    crucial for zoo staff and visitors alike to exercise
                    caution. Despite his reserved nature, Wren is capable of
                    delivering
                    <u>a nasty bite</u> if he perceives a threat within his
                    vicinity. As a result, only senior zookeepers, equipped with
                    the experience and understanding of Wren's behavior, are
                    allowed to enter his designated area for maintenance and
                    care.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The strict access policy ensures both the safety of the
                    zookeepers and the well-being of Wren.

                  <p>
                    Aspen, the dwarf caiman at the zoo, is a captivating and
                    distinctive reptile that adds an element of intrigue to the
                    exhibit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite his entertaining nature, Aspen comes with a cautious
                    note for those looking after him. Dwarf caimans, like Aspen,
                    have a natural <u>instinct to bite </u> when they feel
                    threatened or in danger. This characteristic adds a layer of
                    complexity to interacting with Aspen, emphasizing the
                    importance of understanding his behavior before attempting
                    any close contact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zookeepers, including those who aspire to become reptile
                    experts like the intern, are advised to exercise patience
                    and restraint when working with Aspen. It's crucial to
                    respect his space and refrain from getting too close until a
                    thorough understanding of his behaviors, needs, and
                    potential stressors is acquired. This cautious approach is
                    essential for both the well-being of Aspen and the safety of
                    the zookeepers.

                  <p>
                    Mika, the gharial, is a majestic and impressive resident at
                    our zoo. Stretching close to 15 feet in length, Mika
                    commands attention with his powerful yet elegant
                    presence.Despite his imposing size, Mika is known for his
                    shy nature. He tends to shy away and hide from human
                    presence, preferring the seclusion of he habitat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mika's affinity for fish is a well-known aspect of his diet.
                    His eyes light up with excitement during feeding times,
                    showcasing the natural behaviors of a gharial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's crucial to note that Mika's species is classified as
                    <u>Critically Endangered</u>, highlighting the vulnerability
                    of gharials in their natural habitats. The zoo takes on the
                    responsibility of contributing to conservation efforts
                    through the care and preservation of individuals like Mika.
                    <strong> Regular monitoring </strong>
                    is essential to ensure his well-being, and any interactions
                    with him must be approached with the utmost care and respect
                    for his natural instincts.
