                  Karl is rare white Lion. The white lions are held in high
                  esteem by the local tribes in Timbavati, South Africa. Due to
                  the rarity of the white lion, many were brought into captive
                  breeding. Karl is one such cub who was brought here from
                  Timbavati Private Nature Reserve. He is the youngest one in
                  our zoo. He is just three months old.

                  anything new to show ‘ownership’, even of the keepers, who he
                  mark with tiny hugs! He usually makes his way onto his
